	<feature>
		<name>Power Spectrum Overall Standard Deviation</name>
		<description>A measure of the power of different frequency components.
This is the overall standard deviation over all windows.</description>
		<is_sequential>true</is_sequential>
		<parallel_dimensions>256</parallel_dimensions>
	</feature>
	<feature>
		<name>Spectral Flux Overall Standard Deviation</name>
		<description>A measure of the amount of spectral change in a signal. Found by calculating the change in the magnitude spectrum from frame to frame.
This is the overall standard deviation over all windows.</description>
		<is_sequential>true</is_sequential>
		<parallel_dimensions>1</parallel_dimensions>
	</feature>
	<feature>
		<name>Beat Histogram Overall Standard Deviation</name>
		<description>A histogram showing the relative strength of different rhythmic periodicities (tempi) in a signal. Found by calculating the auto-correlation of the RMS.
This is the overall standard deviation over all windows.</description>
		<is_sequential>true</is_sequential>
		<parallel_dimensions>171</parallel_dimensions>
	</feature>
	<feature>
		<name>MFCC Overall Standard Deviation</name>
		<description>MFCC calculations based upon Orange Cow code
This is the overall standard deviation over all windows.</description>
		<is_sequential>true</is_sequential>
		<parallel_dimensions>13</parallel_dimensions>

	<feature>
		<name>Power Spectrum Overall Average</name>
		<description>A measure of the power of different frequency components.
This is the overall average over all windows.</description>
